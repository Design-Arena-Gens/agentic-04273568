        Civics Thrives When Everyone Participates
      </h2>
      <p>
        Inclusive civic life depends on access—access to education, voting, safe forums, and trustworthy information.
        Strengthening civics means removing barriers, listening deeply, and acting together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start where you live: attend a local meeting, join a mutual aid network, or work with classmates on an issue you
        care about. Democracy is a habit we practice every day.
